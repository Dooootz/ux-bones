#PAGES TODO
    MEDIUM PRIORITY*
    >notifications page - basic 
    >friends list page - basic => complete

    HIGH PRIORITY*
    >chat page - functional => lets do the chat page now 
    >search page (similar to profile creation page) - critical criteria implementation
            >> show faked search results based off search filters 
    >profile settings page - edit personal settings - critical criteria implementation
            >> allow users to edit personal information & attributes 



logic should be relatively basic - mock a dummy db & update it to a page using js 

Hard coded all user data as it was an efficient way to get the prototype off the ground
Will create objects with user data & have that rendered dynamically in the final project
